1. what is the main idea of machine learning
2. how many epochs does the following program has(program was not provided so don't know which one they were referring to... But the options are ) (100,200,500,1000).... program not given
3. is it necessary to train the model for the full 500 epochs ?
4. how to return to the live camera after searching for the object(press X mark, interact with the result, modal bottom sheet header, all of the above )
5. how to detect all the objects in the image 
6. Name the method which was used to call the product.location.image.annotate 
7. what should be the url  of visionAPI if we deploy custom model (empty string, CloudvisionAPI, demoProjectlocation)
8. what was used to add convolution to the image (ans : convolution2D and maxpooling)
9. what is the use of the imagedatagenerator in the cats and dogs(to preprocess the image , add convolution )
10. what is the 1st step in training the model (downloading the zip file, extracting the zip content, preprocessing the contents , train the model)
11. What was the function of the method (don't remember the name of the function... Something related to loading the images)
12. How to detect next digits in handwritingÂ program
